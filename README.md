# Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-for-Image-Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for classifying images into two categories: cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset with preprocessing steps and evaluated on a test dataset. It also includes a function to make a single image prediction.
